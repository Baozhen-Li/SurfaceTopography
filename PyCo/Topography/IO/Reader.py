        Returns a list of dictionaries describing the available data channels.

        Each dict has as least the following elements:

        name : str
            Name of the channel. If no name is found in the file,
            "Default" is used. Can be used in a UI for identifying a channel.

        nb_grid_pts : tuple of ints
            Number of grid points in each direction, either 1 or 2 elements
            depending on the dimension of the topography.

        physical_sizes : tuple of floats or None
            If the physical size can be determined from the file, a tuple is
            returned. The tuple has 1 or 2 elements (size_x, size_y), depending
            on the dimension of the topography.

            If the physical size can not be determined from the file, then
            None is returned.

            Note that the physical sizes obtained from the file can be
            overwritten by passing a `physical_sizes` argument to the
            `topography` method that returns the topography object.

        unit : str or tuple (str,??)
            The unit is either a string or tuple (str, ??).

            [I don't know what the tuple means and what the
            type of the second argument can be. I only know I shouldn't
            take those topographies for topobank.]

            This is the unit of the physical size (if given in the file)
            and the units of the heights. Please also see "height_scale_factor"
            below.

         height_scale_factor : float
             Factor which was used to scale the raw numbers from file (which
             can be voltages or some other quantity) to heights with the given
             'unit'. Use `topography.heights()` in order to get the heights.
